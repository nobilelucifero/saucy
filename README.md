Saucy the Dragon
=====

Demo built with Snap.svg 0.1.0. I know the version 0.2.0 is out but I didn't yet have the time to update everything. I assume it'll work better and with less bugs (hopefully!).

## Description

####Go fly Saucy, go fly! Enjoy your freedom and live happily!

Saucy the Dragon is a very experimental demo made possible with Snap.svg and some other Javascript lines. Feel free to dig in the code following the link below. Share if you like it!

> Saucy please, just don't go chasing barbeques!

## Known issues
* On IE10 makes a super funny "bouncy" effect. It's cute but now something I want at all.
* On Firefox renders slowy. I don't know what the problem is actually. Well... I probably know. These things need a lot of optimization. Also, I believe Snap.svg is still quite young for this.
* On Mobile/Tablet works generally just fine. I didn't try Firefox OS or Window Mobile, but if you can, that would be super awesome!
* Sometimes the animation stops (100% sure if you change tab). I presume it's because of Tab's handling by the Browser or simply Snap.svg doesn't "revive" the loop. Maybe it's my fault.

## Closing

My Javacript code it's pretty raw. But if you have suggestions or advices, or if I wrote a weapon of mass destruction, just tell me!
